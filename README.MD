## Motivation
This tool is used to generate the bytecode of a simple smart contract. It makes it simple and easy to quickly get access to your smart contract bytecode.

## Attention
Your contract code must be all in the same `.sol` file. The tool does not support `import` statements at the moment.

## Contribution
If you come across this tool and find it interesting, we can further develop it.
